Popee the performer is a widely loved character from a show simply called "Popee the performer" and in the show-- <br>
Some people <em>platonically</em> grow love for him, though sometimes its not platonic love and they go as to far to say that-- <br>
they draw NSFW of popee like some kaeya fans though i wont show NSFW art of any characters though. Some people like other characters-- <br>
like Kedamono, or this random sun guy, and the show has a pretty large fanbase. Time to roll the credits since im running out of energy! <br>
credits <br>
the people who made popee the performer (i am not affiliated with them in any way they can make me take this website-- <br>
down and i will take it down.)
